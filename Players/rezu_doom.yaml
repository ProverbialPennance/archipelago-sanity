# Q. What is this file?
# A. This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing
#    others to play how they want as well.
#
# Q. How do I use it?
# A. The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the
#    more chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
#    map_shuffle:
#      on: 5
#      off: 15
#
#    Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned
#    off.
#
# Q. I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# A. This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
#    To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
#        http://www.yamllint.com/
#    You can also verify that your Archipelago options are valid at this site:
#        https://archipelago.gg/check

# Your name in-game, limited to 16 characters.
#     {player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#     {PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number, if that slot number is greater than 1.
#     {number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#     {NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name, if the counter value is greater than 1.

    # spawn in each map) the game will use.
    #
    # You need to pick a setting here that matches the difficulty you will be playing
    # on. In stock Doom, ITYTD and HNTR use "easy" spawns, HMP uses "medium", and
    # UV and NM use "hard".
    #
    # If you are playing with a mod that changes this, make sure that you choose the
    # filter appropriate to the difficulty level you are selecting. Many gameplay mods

    # ignored. If you don't select any levels in your chosen WAD, it will force you

  level_order_bias:
    # How closely the randomizer tries to follow the original level order of the

    # before it will consider later levels in logic. This is primarily useful for
    # enforcing at least a bit of difficulty progression rather than being dumped
    # straight from MAP01 to MAP30.

    # The default setting of 25% means it won't require you to go to (e.g.) MAP08
    # until after beating two of the preceding levels.

  local_weapon_bias:
    # How much the randomizer cares about making sure you have access to the
    # weapons in a level before it considers that level to be in logic. Most Doom
    # levels are possible to beat from a pistol start by finding weapons in the
    # level itself, but in the randomizer there is no guarantee the level contains
    # any weapons at all; this setting makes the randomizer ensure that some of
    # the weapons you would normally find in the level are accessible before you
    # enter it.
    #
    # The setting is a percentage; higher values mean the randomizer will try to
    # make more of the weapons accessible before you need to enter the level. At
    # 100% it will not consider a level to be in logic until all of the weapons
    # normally found in it are accessible to you elsewhere.

    #     nrof-maps: (int, fraction, or "all")
    # Require the player to finish this many levels. If "all", all levels included
    # in randomization must be cleared. If set to an integer >= 1, that many
    # levels must be cleared. If a fraction, that fraction of levels is required,
    # e.g. 0.5 would require you to clear 16 of Doom 2's 32 levels.
    #
    #     specific-maps: (list of map names)
    # Require the player to finish these specific maps. Globbing expressions are
    # supported, so `maps: ["E1M?" "E?M8"]` would require the player to beat all
    # of episode 1 and all boss maps in Doom 1, for example. Maps listed here that

  included_item_categories:
    # Which item categories to include in randomization. This controls both which
    # items are replaced with checks, and what the item pool contains.
    #
    # Keys and weapons are always included and cannot be controlled with this
    # option. You must enable at least one category here or generation is likely
    # to fail.
    #
    # For each category, a setting of `1` enables full randomization, and a setting
    # of `0` disables randomization completely. Values in between will randomize the
    # given proportion, e.g. `"powerup": 0.5` will replace half of the powerups in
    # the game with AP checks (and add the original items to the item pool) and
    # leave the rest alone.
    #
    # See `glossary.md` for a description of the different categories and which
    # items they cover.
    #
    # Enabling "medium" categories tends to more than double the number of checks.
    # Enabling all categories tends to increase it by about 10x. Make sure you (and
    # your co-op partners) are prepared for a game with thousands or tens of thousands

    # well-hidden items that are not formally marked as secrets and will not be
    # excluded by this setting. Others mark items that are out in the open or even
    # mandatory to collect as secrets, which can excessively restrict item placement.
    #

  max_weapon_copies:
