# Q. What is this file?
# A. This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing
#    others to play how they want as well.
#
# Q. How do I use it?
# A. The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the
#    more chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
#    map_shuffle:
#      on: 5
#      off: 15
#
#    Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned
#    off.
#
# Q. I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# A. This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
#    To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
#        http://www.yamllint.com/
#    You can also verify that your Archipelago options are valid at this site:
#        https://archipelago.gg/check

# Your name in-game, limited to 16 characters.
#     {player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#     {PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number, if that slot number is greater than 1.
#     {number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#     {NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name, if the counter value is greater than 1.

  ammo_pack_modifier:
    # This option, when set, will modify the quantity of ammo in each ammo pack. This can make the game easier or much, much harder.
    # The available options are:
    # 
    # None: You realized that consistency in ammo pack quantities is one of the few true joys in life, and this causes you to not modify them at all.
    # Max: Each ammo pack will contain the maximum amount of ammo that the game allows. (i.e., you will never, ever run out of ammo.)
    # Double: Each ammo pack will contain twice as much ammo as it normally contains.
    # Half: Each ammo pack will contain half as much ammo as it normally contains.
    # Only Three: Each ammo pack will have an ammo count of 3.
    # Only Two: Each ammo pack will have an ammo count of 2.
    # Only One: Each ammo pack will have an ammo count of 1. (Yes, your Handgun Ammo pack will have a single bullet in it.)
    # Random By Type: Each ammo type's ammo pack will have a random quantity of ammo, and you will get that same quantity of ammo from every pack for that ammo type.
    #     (For example, you receive a Shotgun Shells pack that has a random quantity of 7 ammo. All Shotgun Shells packs will have a quantity of 7.)
    # Random Always: Each ammo pack will have a random quantity of ammo, and that quantity will be randomized every time.
    #     (For example, you receive a Shotgun Shells pack that has a random quantity of 7 ammo. Your next Shotgun Shells pack has a quantity of 4, next has 2, etc.)
