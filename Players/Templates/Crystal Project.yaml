# Q. What is this file?
# A. This file contains options which allow you to configure your multiworld experience while allowing
#    others to play how they want as well.
#
# Q. How do I use it?
# A. The options in this file are weighted. This means the higher number you assign to a value, the
#    more chances you have for that option to be chosen. For example, an option like this:
#
#    map_shuffle:
#      on: 5
#      off: 15
#
#    Means you have 5 chances for map shuffle to occur, and 15 chances for map shuffle to be turned
#    off.
#
# Q. I've never seen a file like this before. What characters am I allowed to use?
# A. This is a .yaml file. You are allowed to use most characters.
#    To test if your yaml is valid or not, you can use this website:
#        http://www.yamllint.com/
#    You can also verify that your Archipelago options are valid at this site:
#        https://archipelago.gg/check

# Your name in-game, limited to 16 characters.
#     {player} will be replaced with the player's slot number.
#     {PLAYER} will be replaced with the player's slot number, if that slot number is greater than 1.
#     {number} will be replaced with the counter value of the name.
#     {NUMBER} will be replaced with the counter value of the name, if the counter value is greater than 1.
name: Player{number}

# Used to describe your yaml. Useful if you have multiple files.

    # 
    # Level Passes: Progressive Levels are added to the pool. They do not affect the party's actual level or level cap. Archipelago will expect you to collect them to access level-gated areas,

    # Level Catch-Up: Progressive Levels are added to the pool. Collecting them will help your party catch up in levels (and LP!) based on the number you've collected. For example, if the Progressive Level
    # Size Setting is 6 (see below), 1 Progressive Level will bring your party's level up to 6, 2 Progressive Levels will bring your party's level up to 12, etc. If your party
    # has already reached that level, no extra levels will be granted. 2 LP are granted per 1 level granted. In-game tracking will light up checks that you have access to based on the number you have collected.

    # 
    # For example, if this is set to 5, and the enemy level of a region is 12, then the Level Gating options would require you to unlock level 17 (or for Level Capped, max level 17) for that region.
    # If it's set to -5, and the enemy level of a region is 12, then the Level Gating options would require you to unlock level 7 (or for Level Capped, max level 7) for that region.
    # 
    # Default is 0, or on-level for the enemy level of a region.
    # 
    # Note: Remember to increase your Max Level (see below) if you want regions with high-level enemies to still be lower level than you.

    # For example, if Progressive Level Size is 6, the three Level Gating options would behave like this:
    #    Level Passes - At the start, areas up to level 6 are considered in logic. The first Progressive Level you collect will signal that areas up to 12 are now logic, the second up to 18, etc.
    #    Level Capped - Your party's level cap starts at 6. The first Progressive Level you collect will increase your party's level cap to 12, the second to 18, and so on.
    #    Level Catch-Up - Your party is leveled up to 6 at the start. The first Progressive Level you collect will bring your party's level up to 12 if it isn't already, the second up to 18, and so on.
    # 
    # This setting will only increase your party's starting level (3 by default) if you pick Level Catch-Up.

    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.

    # Multiworld host instructions:
    # 1. In order to select the mods you'd like to include in randomization, make a folder named "crystal_project_mods" inside your root Archipelago directory.
    # 2. Go to your Steam installation folder for Crystal Project (<YourSteamInstallFolder>/steamapps/workshop/content/1637730) and find the individual folders for the mods you'd like to include.
    # 3. Inside each mod's folder is a mod json. Copy that json to the crystal_project_mods folder you made inside the Archipelago directory.
    # 
    # NOTE: When this setting is on, all Crystal Project players in the multiworld with this setting enabled MUST use the same mods.
